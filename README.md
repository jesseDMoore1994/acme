Running on the windows machines in the lab

Copy the contents of this zip file into the web root for the apache server.

About the webroot variable
-------------------
there is a variable on line 7 of php/Acme.php that specifies the webroot of the server, This variable is used to 
 specify the webroot of the apache server so that the Acme server can request data from big stuff and little stuff via
 http using curl. My username in that variable should be changed to your username if you are using the Apache in the UAH CS labs.

 If you are using another setup, please ask me at jdm0032@uah.edu for specific setup instructions.
